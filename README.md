Who is goind to be a hacker or a cybersecurity protector?

Welcome to this game, called "Security War".

It was created by 2 purposes.

1. I'm an avid fan of Java. I learn OOP concepts, Interface, etc during my programming journey at a college.
I wanted to apply these concepts.
2. Its purpose is to study CCNA and network programming happily.

I will let you know the game's rule specifically.

WARNING > THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURITY.

There are 2 players
player1 is a hacker
player2 is a cybersecurity developer (or protector)

Master(Jiwon or you) already created User class that contains their private information.

This program has 3 Interface (Beginning | Intermediate | Advanced)

As the game goes, Master will give some questions related to each field.

The hacker should solve hacking's field problems.
The protector should solve security's field problems.

If the hacker solves the problem(that is stored in Interface), the master will give he or her a hint
so that the hacker can reach out the user's information.

I am just done with building a basic structure.
All I have to do is to put contents(questions or enjoyable functions).

If you are interested in Java library or Framework, send an email to me please.

I am full of create ideas, but need to learn Java library and Framework.
We can help out each other.

This program is managed by Jiwon Hwang. Also, I am happy for any feedback :)
